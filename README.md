# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning log!  
This repository contains *daily notes*, concepts, and code snippets I wrote while learning Python from scratch.  
I’m currently following beginner-friendly tutorials from [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/@ApnaCollegeOfficial) and applying what I learn through small projects and challenges.

## 🔧 Functions in Python

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `def` keyword        | Used to define a function                                                   |
| Parameters           | Input values passed to a function                                           |
| Return Statement     | Sends a result back to the caller                                           |
| Default Arguments    | Parameters with default values if not provided                             |
| Keyword Arguments    | Calling functions with named arguments                                      |
| Variable Arguments   | `*args` for multiple positional arguments, `**kwargs` for keyword arguments |



## 📂 File I/O in Python

| Task               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `open()`           | Used to open a file. Modes include `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'`, etc.        |
| `read()`           | Reads the entire content of the file as a string.                          |
| `readline()`       | Reads one line at a time.                                                  |
| `readlines()`      | Returns a list where each element is a line in the file.                   |
| `write()`          | Writes content to a file (overwrites in `'w'` mode).                        |
| `append()`         | Adds new content at the end of the file (`'a'` mode).                       |
| `with open(...)`   | Best practice to open files (auto-closes file).                            |
| Common Modes       | `r` = Read, `w` = Write, `a` = Append, `r+` = Read & Write                 |
