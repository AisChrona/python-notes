# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning log!  
This repository contains *daily notes*, concepts, and code snippets I wrote while learning Python from scratch.  
I’m currently following beginner-friendly tutorials from [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/@ApnaCollegeOfficial) and applying what I learn through small projects and challenges.
